Hey there! I'm Toby and I am currently doing a PhD in experimental particle physics analysis!

I'm enthusiastic about physics and all data and statistics-related things. In particular, I am dealing with machine learning-based anomaly detection in particle physics.

In this blog, I am writing about data science-related topics, such as machine learning, descriptive statistics, their applications to problems in particle physics and from time to time also some cool tools that I find intersting and that have made my life easier as a PhD student and data analyst.
